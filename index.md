# User story examples 

A free to use knowledge base to help you write better user stories.

## Getting Started

User stories are a quick and easy way for us to conceptualize the action a person takes towards achieving their intent in a system. Simply follow the formula:

- As a `type of person`, I want to `do something` so that I can `get something`

Here is an example:

- As a Product Manager, I want to view user story examples, so that I can learn their structure

When designing a system (e.g., a product or service) we often create many user stories to conceptualize the end-to-end user experience.

On this site you'll find example user stories organized by type of user experience. These will cover typical use cases, for example:

- Ordering delivery
- Booking travel accomidation
- Purchasing an investment

We'll also provide additional resources to help you write your own.
