# User story examples

A free to use knowledge base to help you write better user stories.

## Getting Started

User stories are a novel way to describe user action and intent when interacting with a system (typically a user inteface).

- [Create A User Story](#create-a-user-story)

### Create A User Story

To create a user story, follow the formula:

As a `persona`, I want to `action` (_an_) `object`, so that I can (_achieve some_) `objective`

#### Persona

The persona is the first person subject of the story, and may be defined by their role in a system e.g.:

- As a new visitor
- As a prospective customer
- As a customer

As infered above, a persona, may transition their role as the navigate a system, end to end.

#### Action, object

An `action` is typically a verb describing a clear interaction with an external object e.g.:

- View
- Select
- add to cart
- check-out

An `object` is any thing (or _collection_ of things) we might interact with e.g.:

- A list of shirts
- A Shirt
- A shopping cart

An object can also include object _properties_ e.g., _shirt colour_.

If we put that together:

- I want to view a list of shirts
- I want to select a shirt colour
- I want to add a shirt to cart
- I want to check-out my cart

#### Objective

An `objective` is the motivation of the action i.e., the intent; the _why_. An objective may be _action oriented_ however, it describes internal desire, rather than external interaction e.g.:

- so that I can explore available options
- so that I can match my preference
- so that I can continue to shop
- so that I can get my shirt

#### Examples

Ok, Lets put that _all_ together. Here are some examples:

- As a visitor, I want to view a list of shirts, so that I can explore available options
- As a prospective customer, I want to select a shirt colour, so that I can match my preference
- As a customer, I want to check-out my cart, so I can get my shirt

As should be be clear in our example, when designing a system (e.g., a product or service) we can create many user stories to conceptualize an end-to-end user experience. This often described as a _backlog_.

On this site you'll find more example backlogs organized by user experience. These will cover a range of typical use cases, e.g.:

- Ordering delivery
- Booking travel accomidation
- Purchasing an investment

### Acceptance Criteria

Digging deeper: you can also elaborate on your user stories (using the [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/)) to establish a detailed step by step description of the action.

We call this acceptance criteria, as it provides a criteria for testing that a story is actionable (hence accepted, or complete).

**Here is an example**

```



```

This concept can be further expanded into multiple scenarios to define more complex interactions:

```


```

We'll also provide additional resources to help you write your own user stories, acceptance criteria and how to organize your backlog
