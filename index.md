# User story examples

A free to use knowledge base to help you write better user stories.

## Getting Started

### Writing user stories

User stories are a quick and easy way for us to conceptualize and describe the action a person takes towards achieving their intent in a system. Sound complicated? Its not.

Writing user stories is easy. Simply follow the formula:

- As a `type of person`, I want to `do something` so that I can `get something`

We can be more precise then that (which we'll explore later) but to start, we simply want to write a formulaic sentence to describe:

- Who the person is (i.e., their persona or role)
- What the person wants to do (i.e., the external action they will take)
- The intent behind their action (i.e., the internal goal motivating their action)

Here is an example:

- As a Product Manager, I want to view user story examples, so that I can learn their structure

Here we have a our person, a Product Manager who, (perhaps like yourself) needs to learn to write user stories for their job. In this regard they want to view user story examples. It is their hope, that by viewing examples, they will be able to better internalize their structure and thus learn to write them.

As you can see the above user story captures this intent very concisely, making it easy to consider how we might better serve their need. For example, by knowing who they are, we can infer certain things they might know or certain ways they go about work. Similarly, by contemplating their internal goals, we can ensure we empathize with their reasoning and work actually serve their need. Finally, by describing the action, we give ourselves something specific to build: for example, a list of user story examples!

On this site you'll find many examples of the above.

We'll also provide additional resources to help you write your own.

For now this is a work in progress but check back soon!
