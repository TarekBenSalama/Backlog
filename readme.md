## What is a user story?

Think of it as a method of _behaviour driven design_.

- User stories are a conceptual device used in designing interfaces to help understand behaviour
- A user story describes the action a person takes towards achieving their intent
- Together, a set of user stories describe the journey

User stories are typicaly used in product developement providing simple product specifications which encourage agile. Moving away from more formal business requirements, user stories encourage developers to empathize with the user and focus on helping them solve their need (as opposed to simply following more formal business requirements, which might result in a poorer user experience).

Or more precisely:

- As a `[persona]` I want to `[action]` `[a/an]` `[object]`

Here we have a Product Manager who, (perhaps like yourself), needs to learn to write user stories for their job. They want to view examples, as it is their hope, they will be able to better internalize their structure and thus learn to write them.

As you can see the above user story captures this intent very concisely, making it easy to consider how we might better serve their need. For example, by knowing who they are, we can infer certain things they might know or certain ways they go about work. Similarly, by contemplating their internal goals, we can ensure we empathize with their reasoning and work actually serve their need. Finally, by describing the action, we give ourselves something specific to build: for example, a list of user story examples!

### Writing scenarios

We might also expand on a user story, to add _scenario(s)_ to detail the granular steps a user takes through their story, for example:

```
Given I have navigated to userstoriesexamples.com
When I visit the home page
Then I find examples of how to write user stories
```
